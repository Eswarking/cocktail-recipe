## Tasks
We want to build a guidebook for us to play the bartender at our next friday evening house party! \
Being completely new (on scale of 0-4, a 0), we'd like the application to show us all the details right from what the drink looks like to its ingredients and its recipe! Agent 007 wouldn't be Agent 007 with his Martini in a beer mug. 

Here are a few tasks to help you get started:


1. Create an about page navigable from the navbar on the home page.

2. Display the list of all cocktails on the Home page, with their name, glass, image, info. (You'll find a few predefined styles in `Cocktail.css`, feel free to add and modify these).


3. To the Cocktail list displayed on the home page, add a button to display the details of the cocktails including, Name, Category, Info, glass, instructions and ingredients.


4. Add search functionality to serach bar, so that the results on the page are filtered and displayed when a search term is entered in the bar

4. Add an option to toggle the theme of the website, Light and Dark
